The vcxproj file in this folder isn't an entire solution to open in Visual Studio. 
It is only some parts of the project configuration. 
It does contain a great many options for the setup of SDL and the build configuration so it should save you some time.
It also contains file paths like 

C:\Users\wsmith\...

that need to be changed for your setup.

You also need to have SDL2 libs in the correct location, and any vaporspec binaries and roms in the output directory.

Additionally, changes need to be made in the program source code for fopen and sprintf to fopen_s and sprintf_s to work securely with windows.
And the new functions have different arguments so those must be changed as well.
